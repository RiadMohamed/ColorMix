# ColorMix

A simple UI design made of a view with borders containing the color mix from slider, surrounded by a 7 pt black border. Three switches for Red, Green and Blue colors along with 3 slider for each color and a reset button. 
Default/Initial status of the app is black mix as all the switches are OFF, the sliders are disabled as long as the switches are set to off, to enable the sliders you must toggle the switches ON. Then when the sliders are activated, you are free to choose your mix to your liking by changing the values of the 3 colors independently. Reset button will toggle OFF the switches disabling the sliders, resetting the app back to itâ€™ss initial/default status.
